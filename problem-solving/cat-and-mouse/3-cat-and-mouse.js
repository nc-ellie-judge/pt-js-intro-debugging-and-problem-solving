You will be given an array containing string representations of the locations of a cat and multiple mice. Hiding holes for mice are represented by "O".
You will also be given one positive integer which represents how far the cat can jump, and a second one representing how far the mouse can move.

Your task is to determine if the cat can catch the mouse before it hides. 

Each space "x" expends 1 of the cat's and mouse's movement. 
The cat and mouse moce simultaneously, so the cat has to catch the mouse before the mouse would go over to a hole "O".
